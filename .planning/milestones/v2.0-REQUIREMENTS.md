# Requirements: aishell v2.0

**Defined:** 2026-01-20
**Core Value:** Run agentic AI harnesses in isolated, reproducible environments without polluting the host system.

## v2.0 Requirements

Requirements for Babashka rewrite. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### CLI Core

- [x] **CLI-01**: User can run `aishell --version` to see version
- [x] **CLI-02**: User can run `aishell --help` to see available commands
- [x] **CLI-03**: User can run `aishell build` to build the Docker image
- [x] **CLI-04**: User can run `aishell` to enter a shell in the container
- [x] **CLI-05**: User can run `aishell claude` to run Claude Code directly
- [x] **CLI-06**: User can run `aishell opencode` to run OpenCode directly
- [x] **CLI-07**: User can run `aishell update` to check for updates
- [x] **CLI-08**: CLI provides clear error messages for invalid commands/options

### Docker Integration

- [x] **DOCK-01**: Tool checks Docker availability before operations
- [x] **DOCK-02**: Tool builds Docker image with embedded Dockerfile template
- [x] **DOCK-03**: Tool caches image builds (rebuilds only when needed)
- [x] **DOCK-04**: Tool runs containers with proper mounts (project at same path as host)
- [x] **DOCK-05**: Tool passes git identity (user.name, user.email) to container
- [x] **DOCK-06**: Tool configures git safe.directory in container
- [x] **DOCK-07**: Container is ephemeral (--rm flag, destroyed on exit)
- [x] **DOCK-08**: Tool supports per-project Dockerfile extension (.aishell/Dockerfile)

### Configuration

- [x] **CONF-01**: Tool reads per-project config from `.aishell/config.yaml`
- [x] **CONF-02**: Config supports `mounts` for additional volume mounts
- [x] **CONF-03**: Config supports `env` for environment passthrough and literals
- [x] **CONF-04**: Config supports `ports` for port mappings
- [x] **CONF-05**: Config supports `docker_args` for arbitrary docker run flags
- [x] **CONF-06**: Config supports `pre_start` for background commands
- [x] **CONF-07**: Tool persists state in `~/.aishell/state.edn`
- [x] **CONF-08**: Build flags (--claude-version, --opencode-version) are persisted

### Validation

- [x] **VAL-01**: Tool validates version strings before use
- [x] **VAL-02**: Tool warns about dangerous docker_args patterns
- [x] **VAL-03**: Tool detects Dockerfile hash changes and warns if rebuild needed

### Cross-Platform

- [x] **PLAT-01**: Tool works on Linux (x86_64, aarch64)
- [x] **PLAT-02**: Tool works on macOS (x86_64, aarch64)
- [x] **PLAT-03**: Tool handles platform-specific path conventions

### Distribution

- [x] **DIST-01**: Tool can be installed via curl|bash one-liner
- [x] **DIST-02**: Tool is distributed as single-file uberscript
- [x] **DIST-03**: Babashka is assumed installed (not bundled)
